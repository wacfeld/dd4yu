Nearly 80% of Americans, including half of Republicans, say Biden is the rightful winner, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday.

Trump’s refusal to accept defeat, even as world leaders congratulate Biden and look to their future relations, caps a tumultuous four years in office with the United States deeply polarized, ravaged by the coronavirus and torn by racial division.

But Trump’s supporters, who as of the latest count gave him more than 72 million votes compared to Biden’s 77 million, have delighted in his combative style and shattering of norms. Trump has eschewed a public concession or the pledge of cooperation typically offered by outgoing presidents.

“It’s an embarrassment, quite frankly,” Biden told reporters on Tuesday. “How can I say this tactfully? I think it will not help the president’s legacy.”

Trump’s fellow Republicans have largely stuck with him, saying he has a right to contest the result. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said Tuesday he would pay up to $1 million from his campaign account to people who come forward with evidence of voter fraud.

But privately, some say Trump must soon produce significant evidence or exit the stage.
