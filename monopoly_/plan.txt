goal: play monopoly a lot to determine most frequented squares

turn:
    roll dice
    log if double
    on third double, go to jail, log jail, end turn
    move based on dice
    log square
    if special square, get directions (or stay still)
    follow directions -- if jail, log jail, end turn
    jump to "log square" until you stop moving (may still be on special square)
    if last roll was double, jump to "roll dice"
    end turn

shuffle:
    set counter
    get 2 random numbers, under deck size
    swap components of deck
    continue until counter runs out
    
rand:
    have seed already in eax
    square seed into edx,eax
    mov ax,dx (middle squared, but halves are reversed for convenience)
    mov [seed],eax
    return eax

components:
    2 decks
    board
    players
    dice
    special squares
    log

_start:
    set counter1
    shuffle 2 decks
    set counter2
    initialize players
    call turn for each player
    repeat last step until counter2 runs out
    repeat from "shuffle 2 decks" until counter1 runs out

    print log
